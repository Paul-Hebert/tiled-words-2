# WIP - Tiled Words

A word game where you reconstruct crosswords out of tiles.

## TODOs

## Major Features

- More levels
- Mobile rotation
- Instructions
- Main screen (New game, continue, etc.)

## UI Design

- Better responsive layout, especially small screen layout improvements
- Better word/hint display
- Micro-interactions for finding word, completing level

## Code quality

- Improve linting rules
- Set up CI
- Improve how levels are defined

## Bugs

- Transitions on tiles aren't working properly

## Lisa feedback

- Tile placement was difficult. Need to fine tune "shadow" logic
- Too easy. Words were obvious from tiles. Starting rotated could help
- Rotation needs to be easy. Maybe tap to rotate?
